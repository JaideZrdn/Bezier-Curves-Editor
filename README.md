# Bezier Curves Editor
An app to edit and display Bezier Curves

## Overview

This project was a work of the discipline _"Introduction To Graphic Computing"_ on _UFAM_ (Federal University of Amazonas). The focus was on be able to use the bezier function to display those points and curves, and be able to edit it.

## Key Features

- Put, organize and delete **control** **points**
- Visualize those **coordinates**
- Construct the **Curve** using those points and the Bezier Algorithm
- See the **Control** **Polygon**

## Technologies used

- **SwiftUI** Canvas
- **MVVM** architecture
- Paths
- **Gestures** (Tap, Drag)

## What I Learned

- How we can construct Curves on a computer
- How to use **Canvas** in SwiftUI
- How to use multiple **Gestures** in a single **View**
